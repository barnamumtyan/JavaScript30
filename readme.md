# JavaScript30

What I've learned from each module:

### 01 - Javascript Drum Kit

- Adding a 'transitionend' listener instead of a timeout, because timout can get out of synch with the css transition

### 02 - JS and CSS Clock

- transform origin css property used for rotation

### 03 - CSS Variables

- new CSS variables that can be updated with javascript
- data attributes, and using the dataset property from an event to get all the data attributes

### 04 - Array Cardio
- nothing new
